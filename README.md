## üì¶ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    - Ensure you have a local web server stack installed (e.g., [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/), [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/), or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/)).

2.  **Clone/Download the Project:**
    - Download the source code and extract it into your web server's root directory (e.g., `xampp/htdocs/`).
    - Rename the folder to `job-portal2` or something meaningful.

3.  **Database Setup:**
    - Start your Apache and MySQL services from your server stack control panel.
    - Open phpMyAdmin (usually at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    - Create a new database named `job-portal` (or any name you prefer).
    - Import the provided SQL file (e.g., `database/job-portal.sql`) into your new database to create the necessary tables.

4.  **Configuration:**
    - Locate the PHP configuration file (often named `config.php` or `database.php` in the project's root or an `includes/` folder).
    - Update the database connection variables with your local credentials:
        `$host = 'localhost';`
        `$dbname = 'job-portal';`
        `$username = 'root'; // Default XAMPP username`
        `$password = ''; // Default XAMPP password is empty`

5.  **Run the Application:**
    - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/job-portal2` (or the name of your project folder).
